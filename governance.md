# Governance (Authoritative)

This document is the authoritative, enforceable operating model for Context-Engineering.

For exploratory ideas, options, and future-looking notes, see `canvas.md`.

---

## Organizational Model

### Executive Sponsor — Josh (current assignment)

- Sets vision, priorities, and constraints
- Decides what becomes public vs private
- Approves publishable artifacts

### AI Governance Manager — ChatGPT (current assignment)

- Helps design and maintain the context system
- Produces prompts, reviews agent output, and enforces standards
- Maintains private operational knowledge
- Prepares sanitized artifacts for publication

### Compliance Officer — Codex (current assignment)

- Reviews implementation output for alignment with this operating model
- Checks for security leaks, scope creep, and Plane A vs Plane B violations
- Uses deterministic checklists (not “looks good” intuition)
- Recommends approve / request changes; does not merge protected changes without Executive Sponsor sign-off
- Posts the PR Review Report as a comment on every PR it reviews (required artifact)

### Implementation Specialist — Copilot / Codex / Continue / Others (current assignments)

- Execute tasks using provided context
- Operate primarily on repo-local, public-safe context
- Do not retain long-term memory; context must be supplied

### Business Analyst (proposal and analysis role)

- Performs exploratory analysis and planning
- Proposes changes and drafts work orders
- Does not approve protected changes

### Role assignment principle

- Roles define responsibility, authority, and escalation
- Tools and humans are assignment metadata, not role identity
- Canonical role charters live in `00-os/role-charters/`

### Canonical role terminology

The canonical role vocabulary for this repo is:

- Executive Sponsor
- AI Governance Manager
- Compliance Officer
- Implementation Specialist
- Business Analyst

Use canonical role names in PR metadata, labels, approvals, and documentation.
Legacy role terms are deprecated and must not be introduced in new artifacts.

### Legacy role mapping (for reference)

| Legacy reference | Canonical role | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| CEO (Josh) | Executive Sponsor | Final approval responsibility for protected changes |
| Director of AI Context (ChatGPT) | AI Governance Manager | Context-system ownership and curation |
| Reviewer / Merge Agent — Codex | Compliance Officer | Deterministic compliance review function |
| Agents (Copilot/Codex/Continue/Others) | Implementation Specialist | Execution role, tool-agnostic |
| Exploratory analysis / proposal | Business Analyst | Proposal and planning role |

## Two-Plane Context Model

### Plane A — Public / Portable Context

**Lives with the code. Safe for public repos.**

Includes:

- Repo-specific Copilot instructions
- Architecture and workflow documentation
- Public-safe prompts and runbooks
- Sanitized decision logs
- Agent working agreements

Purpose:

- Make repos self-contained
- Enable tool/LLM portability
- Allow public sharing without redaction anxiety

### Plane B — Private / Operational Context

**Lives in a private Context-Engineering repo.**

Includes:

- Executive Sponsor / AI Governance Manager / Implementation Specialist operating system
- Prompt templates with internal assumptions
- Unredacted session canvases
- Tool behavior notes and quirks
- Security and redaction rules

Purpose:

- Act as the durable system of record
- Allow fast, unsanitized thinking
- Feed curated context into Plane A

---

## Canvas Lifecycle

### 1. Session Canvas (Private)

- Created during active ChatGPT sessions
- May include sensitive data, internal URLs, raw ideas
- Updated continuously during a working thread

### 2. Publishable Extract (Curated)

- Subset of the session canvas
- Explicitly marked as safe for repo inclusion
- Reviewed by Executive Sponsor before publication

### 3. Repo Canvas (Public-Safe)

- Added to the target repo under `docs/ai/`
- Becomes durable context for agents
- Used by Implementation Specialists (Copilot / Codex / Continue) going forward

**Rule:** Chat history is ephemeral. Canvases are durable.

---

## Canvas to Governance Promotion (Formal Process)

Use this process when promoting an idea from `canvas.md` into authoritative policy.

### 1. Promotion eligibility

An idea is eligible for promotion only when:

- Scope and language are stable
- Governance impact is clear
- Ownership and approval boundaries are explicit
- Required supporting artifacts are identified (templates, charters, checklists) where applicable

### 2. Required Issue content

Promotion work is issue-first and the Issue must define:

- Objective (what policy change is being proposed)
- Source context (link to relevant `canvas.md` section or heading)
- Scope and constraints
- Definition of done
- Required supporting artifact updates (if any)

### 3. Required implementation and PR flow

1. Create the Issue
2. Create the branch from the Issue using `gh issue develop <ISSUE_NUMBER> --checkout`
3. Implement the governance change with minimal scope
4. Remove or reduce the promoted idea in `canvas.md` so only unresolved exploratory content remains
5. Open a PR that links/closes the Issue and includes required role attribution metadata and labels
6. Complete Compliance Officer review, including the required PR Review Report comment

### 4. Approval and merge requirements

- Changes to `governance.md` are protected changes
- Executive Sponsor approval is required before merge
- Merge only after required review and approval signals are present

### 5. Post-merge hygiene

- Ensure `canvas.md` no longer contains ratified policy language that now lives in `governance.md`
- If only part of an idea was promoted, keep only the remaining open questions in `canvas.md`
- Update related references (for example, glossary, templates, or role charters) only when required by the promoted change

---

## Change Management: Issue / PR Process (reviewable edits)

All meaningful changes in this repo should be **reviewable**. The default workflow is **Issue → Branch → Pull Request → Review → Merge**.

### Goals

- Make edits auditable and reversible
- Reduce “random walk” documentation
- Provide a clear contract between agents and reviewers

### Default workflow
1. **Create an Issue** (Executive Sponsor, AI Governance Manager, Business Analyst, or Implementation Specialist) defining: objective, scope, constraints, and definition of done
2. **Create the branch from the Issue** using `gh issue develop <ISSUE_NUMBER> --checkout` (role occupant)
3. **Implement on the branch** with focused commits and role-attributed commit messages
4. **Open a Pull Request** using templates and checklists, including machine-readable PR metadata (see Role Attribution). PR description must link and close the Issue (example: `Closes #<ISSUE_NUMBER>`)
5. **Apply PR labels** (role occupant) immediately after PR creation using GitHub UI, API/automation, or `gh` to self-identify role and set initial status
6. **Review**

   - Compliance Officer reviews for compliance (structure, security, scope, Plane A/B boundaries)
   - Compliance Officer posts the PR Review Report as a PR comment on the PR (required)
   - Reviewer updates PR labels to reflect outcome (approved / changes requested)
   - AI Governance Manager / Executive Sponsor makes final call for sensitive changes

7. **Merge** (human merge for protected changes; update status labels)

**Rules (Required):**
- Issue-first: every PR maps to an existing Issue.
- Branch creation for Issue work must use `gh issue develop <ISSUE_NUMBER> --checkout`.
- No manual `git checkout -b` for Issue-driven PR work.
- Issues must define objective, scope, constraints, and definition of done.

### Issue/PR triage (blocker vs follow-up vs note)

Use the following triage classes for in-flight findings during Issue/PR work:

- **Blocker:** must be resolved in the current PR before approval/merge.
- **Follow-up:** create a linked Issue; keep the current PR scoped.
- **Note:** keep as a note/checklist/comment; no new Issue required unless promoted to follow-up.

**If no Issue exists (fallback sequence):**
1) `gh issue create ...`
2) `gh issue develop <ISSUE_NUMBER> --checkout`
3) implement + PR

### Protected changes (require Executive Sponsor approval)

- `governance.md` and `context-flow.md`
- Anything under `00-os/` (operating system & guardrails)
- Any change that affects Plane A vs Plane B boundaries

### Low-risk changes (can be fast-tracked)

- New templates under `10-templates/`
- Placeholder vendor notes under `30-vendor-notes/`
- New session canvas instances under `20-canvases/`

### Review gate (minimum)

- No secrets / tokens / internal hostnames / personal data
- No new top-level folders without explicit instruction
- Changes are scoped to the Issue
- Templates and checklists preferred over long prose
- TODOs added where human judgment is needed

### Role-repo instruction publication gate (required)

Any PR that changes role-instruction generation logic, role-repo templates, or generated `AGENTS.md` contract content must include:

- clear scope tied to an Issue
- explicit mapping to affected role(s)
- deterministic validation evidence (for example, render output checks)
- Compliance Officer review for governance alignment

Until a dedicated HR role is ratified, Compliance Officer is the required reviewer for instruction-contract alignment.

### PR lifecycle: close / supersede / cleanup
PRs are not deleted; they are merged or closed. Prefer `gh` over manual UI.

**Close a PR** when:
- It is stale/abandoned
- It is out of scope and rescoping is not worth it
- It is superseded by another PR

**Prefer rescoping (rewrite/rebase)** when:
- The PR is fundamentally correct but contains extra commits/files

**Closure hygiene (required):**
1) Leave a final comment stating why it is being closed and (if applicable) what replaces it.
2) Apply exactly one status label:
   - `status:closed` (default)
   - `status:superseded` (use instead of `status:closed` when replaced by another PR)
   - Remove any `status:needs-review`, `status:changes-requested`, `status:approved`
3) Delete the remote branch after closing unless intentionally retained.

**Canonical `gh` commands**
Close with comment:

```bash
gh pr close <PR_NUMBER> --comment "Closing PR: <reason>. Superseded by #<NEW_PR_NUMBER> (if applicable)." --delete-branch
```

Set closed labels:

```bash
gh pr edit <PR_NUMBER> --add-label "status:closed" --remove-label "status:superseded" --remove-label "status:needs-review" --remove-label "status:changes-requested" --remove-label "status:approved" --remove-label "status:merged"
```

Add superseded label (optional):

```bash
gh pr edit <PR_NUMBER> --add-label "status:superseded" --remove-label "status:closed" --remove-label "status:needs-review" --remove-label "status:changes-requested" --remove-label "status:approved" --remove-label "status:merged"
```

If the branch should be retained, omit the `--delete-branch` flag.

## Role Attribution & Auditability (Humans vs Tools)

Because all GitHub actions are authenticated under the same human identity (`joshphillipssr`), **explicit role attribution is required** to preserve auditability and intent.

The goal is to make it immediately clear:

- Which role performed the work
- Which role reviewed it
- Which role approved protected changes

### Required attribution mechanisms

At least **two** of the following must be used on every Pull Request (and at least one on every Issue). Using more is encouraged for clarity.

**Required for PRs:**

- Machine-readable PR metadata (below)
- GitHub labels (below)

#### 1. Commit message prefixes (preferred)

Use a clear prefix in commit messages:

- `[Implementation Specialist]` — work generated or scaffolded for execution
- `[Compliance Officer]` — review-driven or corrective changes based on compliance analysis
- `[AI Governance Manager]` — context-system ownership and curation changes
- `[Business Analyst]` — proposal or planning artifacts
- `[Executive Sponsor]` — approval decisions or direct edits by the sponsor

Example:

```text
[Implementation Specialist] scaffold Context-Engineering templates
[Compliance Officer] fix tier naming inconsistencies
[Executive Sponsor] approve protected-path changes
```

#### 2. Machine-readable PR metadata (required)

Every PR description must include the following fields (exact keys), so humans and automation can parse intent reliably:

- `Primary-Role: Executive Sponsor|AI Governance Manager|Compliance Officer|Business Analyst|Implementation Specialist`
- `Reviewed-By-Role: Compliance Officer|Executive Sponsor|N/A`
- `Executive-Sponsor-Approval: Required|Not-Required|Provided`

These fields do not replace narrative description; they make attribution auditable.

#### 3. GitHub labels (required for PRs)

Labels make role and status visible at a glance and must be applied on every PR.

**Role labels (pick all that apply):**

- `role:executive-sponsor`
- `role:ai-governance-manager`
- `role:compliance-officer`
- `role:business-analyst`
- `role:implementation-specialist`

**Optional:**

- `role:executive-sponsor-approved` — use when a protected-path approval comment exists (redundant but sometimes convenient)

**Status labels (pick one current status):**

- `status:needs-review`
- `status:changes-requested`
- `status:approved`
- `status:merged`
- `status:closed`
- `status:superseded`

**Rule:** Labels must be applied/updated by the actor (Implementation Specialist / Compliance Officer / Executive Sponsor) using GitHub UI, API/automation, or `gh` as part of the workflow.

#### Legacy terminology treatment (deprecated)

Legacy role terms are allowed only as historical references (for example, in the legacy mapping table). They are **not** valid for PR metadata or labels.

If a PR description, comment, or label uses legacy role terms (for example: `CEO`, `Director of AI Context`, `role:CEO`, `CEO-Approval`), reviewers must request changes and require replacement with canonical role terminology.

#### 4. Label application methods (UI/API/`gh`) with canonical `gh` examples

The allowed methods are GitHub UI, GitHub API/automation, or `gh`. The commands below are optional examples, not exclusive requirements.

Agents may have access to a shell with `gh` configured under the Executive Sponsor identity. When labeling is required, use these canonical commands:

Apply initial labels after PR creation (example PR #3):

```bash
gh pr edit 3 --add-label "role:implementation-specialist" --add-label "status:needs-review" --remove-label "status:changes-requested" --remove-label "status:approved" --remove-label "status:merged" --remove-label "status:closed" --remove-label "status:superseded"
```

Update labels after Compliance Officer review (REQUEST CHANGES):

```bash
gh pr edit 3 --add-label "role:compliance-officer" --add-label "status:changes-requested" --remove-label "status:needs-review" --remove-label "status:approved" --remove-label "status:merged" --remove-label "status:closed" --remove-label "status:superseded"
```

Update labels after Compliance Officer review (APPROVE):

```bash
gh pr edit 3 --add-label "role:compliance-officer" --add-label "status:approved" --remove-label "status:needs-review" --remove-label "status:changes-requested" --remove-label "status:merged" --remove-label "status:closed" --remove-label "status:superseded"
```

Post PR Review Report comment (required):
```bash
gh pr comment <PR_NUMBER> --body-file <PATH_TO_PR_REVIEW_REPORT_MD>
```

On merge:

```bash
gh pr edit 3 --add-label "status:merged" --remove-label "status:approved" --remove-label "status:needs-review" --remove-label "status:changes-requested" --remove-label "status:closed" --remove-label "status:superseded"
```

#### 5. Explicit PR comments for protected approval

Protected-path changes **must** include an explicit PR comment from the Executive Sponsor.

Example:
> **Executive Sponsor approval:**  
> I approve this pull request, including changes under protected paths (`00-os/`), per the Change Management rules defined in `governance.md`.

### Non-goals

- GitHub author identity is **not** used to infer role
- Automated bot identities are optional and not required
- Attribution must be human-readable and reviewable in the PR timeline
- Long-term, prefer least-privilege tokens or GitHub automation for agent actions (labeling/commenting) even if they run under the Executive Sponsor identity today

**Rule:** If an auditor cannot tell *who did what and why* from the PR alone, attribution is insufficient.

## Instruction Layering

### Global (Private)

- Stored in Context-Engineering
- Principles, standards, prompt patterns

### Repo-Specific (Public-Safe)

- `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- Focused, minimal, repo-scoped

### Tool Adapters

- Copilot, Continue, Codex each consume context differently
- Repo context is the shared baseline

### Agent Job Description Contract (required)

`AGENT INSTRUCTIONS = ROLE-BASED JOB DESCRIPTION`

For role repositories, the canonical instruction artifact is:

- `AGENTS.md` at repository root

`AGENTS.md` must be generated from repository-governed role sources and treated as a role contract, not free-form prompt text.

Required source chain (authoritative order):

1. `governance.md`
2. `00-os/role-charters/`
3. approved role-instruction templates (for example, `10-templates/agent-instructions/`)
4. generated role-repo `AGENTS.md`

If any lower layer conflicts with a higher layer, the higher layer is authoritative.

#### Required AGENTS.md structure

Each generated role-repo `AGENTS.md` must define, at minimum:

1. Role mission and purpose
2. Responsibilities
3. Explicit non-responsibilities
4. Authority boundaries and approval limits
5. Required operating workflow
6. Escalation triggers
7. Prohibited actions
8. Output and quality standards
9. Source metadata (generation source/ref/time)

#### Ambiguity control

`AGENTS.md` must use deterministic language (`must`, `must not`, `should`) and avoid ambiguous authority boundaries.
If an instruction cannot be interpreted deterministically, the assigned agent must escalate.

#### Tool adapter policy

Tool-specific instruction files are adapters, not alternate policy sources.

- `AGENTS.md` is canonical.
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` must point to `AGENTS.md` and must not redefine role authority.
- Other adapters (Codex, Ollama, etc.) may reformat but must preserve role meaning and boundaries.

---

## Security Model

### Sensitivity Tiers

1. **Public** — safe for public repos
2. **Internal** — private repo only
3. **Secret** — never committed (keys, tokens)

### Practices

- Secrets scanning on public repos
- Publishable Extract section required for promotion
- Assume Plane A is always world-readable

---

## Persistence Strategy

- No critical knowledge lives only in chat history
- Every meaningful session updates a canvas
- Repo canvases are the only inputs agents can rely on long-term
