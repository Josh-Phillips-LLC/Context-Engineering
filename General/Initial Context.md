# Initial Context

We’re working on an ongoing project. Please review the attached PDF, which contains the ticket used to track time and work performed. Once you've reviewed it, we’ll begin our session.

Here are a few guidelines for how I’d like our collaboration to work:

1. Do not assume I want you to start writing or editing code immediately.
2. I prefer to begin with a strategic discussion before making any changes.
3. Please offer suggestions and ask clarifying questions. When I’m ready for you to begin coding or editing, I’ll say something like “let’s do it” or “sounds good”—that’s your cue to start.
4. When responding, clearly distinguish between factually verified information and general patterns inferred from your training data.  
   - If you're unsure, use phrases like “based on typical patterns…” or “this is likely how it works in general.”  
   - If the information is confirmed and supported by reliable sources, speak definitively and include references when possible.



## Ticket Entry Context
I need to create the body for a time entry for all of the work we've done in this session. This time entry will be what is added to the existing "Ticket Print View.pdf" i have been providing with each prompt so that the session context is appended with relevent data from this session. You can reference that PDF to understand how the time entry body should be structured. Here are the rules:

Task Body

- Formatting: Use concise, bullet points starting with a dash (`-`), Sub-bullets (starting with `--`), sub-sub-bullets (starting with '---'), etc. I am using this format for these instructions as an example.
 - Perspective & Voice:
 -- Use an 'Implied First-Person' Voice: The entry should be written as if the user ("Josh") wrote it, but without using personal pronouns.
--- STRICTLY OMIT all personal pronouns like "I", "my", "we", or "our".**
----Incorrect: "I pivoted my investigation to a different tool."
---- Correct: "Pivoted investigation to a different tool."
- Content Principles (The Gold Standard):
-- Guiding Philosophy - Write for an audience of three:
--- The primary goal is to create an entry that is both a concise log for a senior peer and an educational guide for a junior technician. These are the first two members of the audience. The entry must be clear enough for a lower-level tech to follow the diagnostic steps and learn from the thought process.
--- Additionally, this entry will be added to the existing PDF and serve as context for the next session, so you are also writing to provide yourself (the third member of the audience) context to pick up where we have left off.
-- Action-Oriented: Start bullets with strong, past-tense verbs (e.g., `Investigated`, `Configured`, `Tested`, `Restarted`, `Removed`).
-- Chronological Narrative: The bullets must tell the story of the work session in the order it happened.
--- Log Thought Process: Document the *why* behind actions, especially after a failure. Clearly state the observations that led to the next step. The time entry should tell a story.
-- Be Economical with Words: Write with extreme conciseness. Omit filler words.
-- Be Specific: Use the exact technical names, hostnames, and technologies discussed (e.g., `WPCC-DC1-01`, `DiagnosticsCollector.ps1`, `Set-ExecutionPolicy`).
- Enclose the entire time entry body in markdown so that it is rendered in plaintext for me to copy/paste into an Autotask Time entry.
- Be extremely detailed. While the wording should be concise, that doesn't mean there won't be a lot of content.
