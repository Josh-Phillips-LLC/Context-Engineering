# Markdown Instructions

## List Spacing (MD032)

- Always add a blank line before and after any list (ordered or unordered).
- For nested lists (e.g., bullets under a numbered item), add a blank line before the nested list and a blank line after it.
- When a heading or paragraph introduces a list (e.g., "Includes:"), insert a blank line between the intro line and the list.

## Headings Need Blank Lines (MD022)

- Always insert a blank line after headings before any paragraph, list, or other content.
- Apply this to all heading levels (`#` through `######`), including subheadings.

## Fenced Code Blocks Need Blank Lines (MD031)

- Add a blank line before and after every fenced code block.
- Do this even when the code block follows a short label line like "Example:" or "Command:".

## Multiple Blank Lines (MD012)

- Avoid consecutive blank lines; keep a single blank line between blocks.
- After fenced code blocks, use exactly one blank line before the next content.

## Fenced Code Language (MD040)

- Always include a language identifier on fenced code blocks (e.g., `bash`, `text`, `yaml`).
- Use `text` when no specific language is appropriate.

## File End Newline (MD047)

- Ensure every Markdown file ends with a single newline.
- Avoid missing or multiple trailing blank lines at the end of the file.
