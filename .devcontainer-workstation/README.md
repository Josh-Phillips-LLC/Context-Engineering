# Devcontainer Workstation Setup

This workflow builds the container from scratch outside VS Code, then attaches VS Code to the running container.
It supports role-scoped startup for:

- `implementation-workstation` (default `Implementation Specialist` profile)
- `compliance-workstation` (`Compliance Officer` profile)
- `systems-architect-workstation` (`Systems Architect` profile)

## 1) Build and start from host

Run these from your host machine terminal (not inside a container):

```bash
cd /path/to/Context-Engineering/.devcontainer-workstation

if docker compose version >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  COMPOSE_CMD="docker compose"
else
  COMPOSE_CMD="docker-compose"
fi

# Optional: set this before startup when ROLE_GITHUB_AUTH_MODE=user and
# the workspace repo is private or you want non-interactive first-boot auth.
export GH_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN="<your_pat>"
export WORKSTATION_DEBUG="true" # optional: verbose init-workstation logging

# Optional: role GitHub App auth (preferred for role-attributable actions)
# ROLE_GITHUB_AUTH_MODE defaults to "app" in role profiles. If you are not
# providing App credentials, set ROLE_GITHUB_AUTH_MODE="user" to skip.
# Keep GH_TOKEN/GITHUB_TOKEN unset in app mode; those env vars override
# role-app identity for gh/MCP calls when present in container env.
# The private key path must be mounted into the container (file path only).
# export ROLE_GITHUB_AUTH_MODE="app"
# export ROLE_GITHUB_APP_ID="<app-id>"
# export ROLE_GITHUB_APP_INSTALLATION_ID="<installation-id>"
# export ROLE_GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH="/run/secrets/role_github_app_private_key"

# Default role-scoped startup (Implementation Specialist)
$COMPOSE_CMD down
$COMPOSE_CMD up -d --build implementation-workstation

# Optional: Compliance Officer role-scoped container
# $COMPOSE_CMD --profile compliance-officer up -d --build compliance-workstation

# Optional: Systems Architect role-scoped container
# $COMPOSE_CMD --profile systems-architect up -d --build systems-architect-workstation
```

## 1a) Start from published GHCR role packages

Role packages are published by `.github/workflows/publish-role-workstation-images.yml` and can be consumed without local image builds.

```bash
cd /path/to/Context-Engineering/.devcontainer-workstation

if docker compose version >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  COMPOSE_CMD="docker compose"
else
  COMPOSE_CMD="docker-compose"
fi

# Optional overrides:
# export GHCR_OWNER="<github-org-or-user>"
# export GHCR_IMAGE_TAG="latest"
# export WORKSPACE_REPO_OWNER="Josh-Phillips-LLC"

$COMPOSE_CMD -f docker-compose.ghcr.yml down
$COMPOSE_CMD -f docker-compose.ghcr.yml up -d implementation-workstation
# Optional:
# $COMPOSE_CMD -f docker-compose.ghcr.yml --profile compliance-officer up -d compliance-workstation
# $COMPOSE_CMD -f docker-compose.ghcr.yml --profile systems-architect up -d systems-architect-workstation
```

Default package names:

- `ghcr.io/josh-phillips-llc/context-engineering-workstation-implementation-specialist:latest`
- `ghcr.io/josh-phillips-llc/context-engineering-workstation-compliance-officer:latest`
- `ghcr.io/josh-phillips-llc/context-engineering-workstation-systems-architect:latest`

Release naming and versioning conventions:

- Role repo names: `context-engineering-role-<role-slug>`
- Image names: `ghcr.io/<owner>/context-engineering-workstation-<role-slug>`
- Image tags:
  - `latest`
  - `<role-slug>-latest`
  - `<role-slug>-<short-sha>`

Verify the published platforms include both `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`:

```bash
docker buildx imagetools inspect ghcr.io/josh-phillips-llc/context-engineering-workstation-implementation-specialist:latest
docker buildx imagetools inspect ghcr.io/josh-phillips-llc/context-engineering-workstation-compliance-officer:latest
docker buildx imagetools inspect ghcr.io/josh-phillips-llc/context-engineering-workstation-systems-architect:latest
```

If you exported `GH_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN` for startup bootstrap, clear it after the container is running:

```bash
unset GH_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN
```

If role GitHub App auth is configured, verify the role identity inside the container:

```bash
gh auth status --hostname github.com
gh api graphql -f query='{viewer{login}}' --jq '.data.viewer.login'
```

If App auth variables are missing, startup logs a warning and continues without App auth.

Use this only if you want a full reset of persisted container data:

```bash
$COMPOSE_CMD down -v
$COMPOSE_CMD up -d --build
```

`down -v` removes all role-prefixed named volumes (for example, `implementation_gh_config` and `compliance_gh_config`), so GitHub auth, cloned repos, and other persisted container state are reset.
Codex config is re-seeded from `.devcontainer-workstation/codex/config.toml` when `/root/.codex` is recreated.

Role containers now use role-prefixed named volumes, so running multiple role containers at once does not share `/workspace` or runtime config state between roles.
Each role has isolated volumes for workspace data, GitHub auth config, git config, and codex home.

Confirm container is running:

```bash
$COMPOSE_CMD ps
docker ps --filter name=implementation-workstation
docker ps --filter name=compliance-workstation
```

If a role container is not `Up`, inspect logs:

```bash
$COMPOSE_CMD logs --tail=200 implementation-workstation
$COMPOSE_CMD logs --tail=200 compliance-workstation
```

## 2) Clone role repos into container-owned storage

The workspace root inside the container is `/workspace` (Docker volume-backed).
On container startup, each role container auto-clones its role repo by default:

- `implementation-workstation`
  - URL: `https://github.com/Josh-Phillips-LLC/context-engineering-role-implementation-specialist.git`
  - Path: `/workspace/Projects/context-engineering-role-implementation-specialist`
- `compliance-workstation`
  - URL: `https://github.com/Josh-Phillips-LLC/context-engineering-role-compliance-officer.git`
  - Path: `/workspace/Projects/context-engineering-role-compliance-officer`
- `systems-architect-workstation`
  - URL: `https://github.com/Josh-Phillips-LLC/context-engineering-role-systems-architect.git`
  - Path: `/workspace/Projects/context-engineering-role-systems-architect`

Verify clone status:

```bash
docker exec -it implementation-workstation bash -lc 'ls -la /workspace/Projects/context-engineering-role-implementation-specialist'
docker exec -it compliance-workstation bash -lc 'ls -la /workspace/Projects/context-engineering-role-compliance-officer'
docker exec -it systems-architect-workstation bash -lc 'ls -la /workspace/Projects/context-engineering-role-systems-architect'
```

If auto-clone failed, run manual PAT auth and clone inside the container:

```bash
docker exec -it implementation-workstation bash

# One-time fallback auth inside container (HTTPS + PAT)
read -s -p "GitHub PAT: " GH_PAT; echo
printf '%s' "$GH_PAT" | env -u GH_TOKEN -u GITHUB_TOKEN gh auth login --hostname github.com --git-protocol https --with-token
gh auth setup-git
gh auth status
unset GH_PAT

cd /workspace/Projects
git clone https://github.com/Josh-Phillips-LLC/context-engineering-role-implementation-specialist.git
exit
```

`gh` auth is persisted in each role's role-prefixed gh config volume, so this login should not be required every time for that role.
If needed, you can override default role repo targets with:

- `IMPLEMENTATION_WORKSPACE_REPO_URL`
- `COMPLIANCE_WORKSPACE_REPO_URL`
- `SYSTEMS_ARCHITECT_WORKSPACE_REPO_URL`
- `IMPLEMENTATION_WORKSPACE_REPO_DIR_NAME`
- `COMPLIANCE_WORKSPACE_REPO_DIR_NAME`
- `SYSTEMS_ARCHITECT_WORKSPACE_REPO_DIR_NAME`

## 3) Attach VS Code to running container

In local (non-containerized) VS Code:

1. Open Command Palette
2. Run `Dev Containers: Attach to Running Container...`
3. Select `implementation-workstation`, `compliance-workstation`, or `systems-architect-workstation`
4. Open folder matching the role container:
   - `/workspace/Projects/context-engineering-role-implementation-specialist`
   - `/workspace/Projects/context-engineering-role-compliance-officer`
  - `/workspace/Projects/context-engineering-role-systems-architect`

## 4) Codex config defaults

The container seeds `/root/.codex/config.toml` from `.devcontainer-workstation/codex/config.toml` when the target file is missing.
Then `init-workstation.sh` applies role overlays from `.devcontainer-workstation/codex/role-profiles/` based on `ROLE_PROFILE`.
If `ROLE_PROFILE` is not set at runtime, it defaults to the image-baked `IMAGE_ROLE_PROFILE` value.
It also generates a runtime instruction file at `/workspace/instructions/role-instructions.md`.
In addition, it generates adapter files at:

- `/workspace/instructions/AGENTS.md`
- `/workspace/instructions/copilot-instructions.md`

Instruction source resolution order:

1. role repo `AGENTS.md` (`<workspace-role-repo>/AGENTS.md`)
2. image-baked compiled role instructions (`/etc/codex/runtime-role-instructions/<role>.md`)
3. image-baked fallback sources (`/etc/codex/agent-instructions/`)

Role-specific images bake `/etc/codex/runtime-role-instructions/<role>.md` from role-repo artifacts when available at build time, and fall back to repository-defined instruction sources when unavailable.

If the workspace repo directory does not exist at startup (for example, clone failure), the init script does not create it; runtime role instructions are still materialized from baked sources.

For `Compliance Officer`, the runtime file includes the PR review protocol from `10-templates/compliance-officer-pr-review-brief.md` (or the image fallback copy when the workspace file is not present).

The init script also ensures VS Code chat defaults at `/workspace/settings/vscode/settings.json`:

- `"github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.useInstructionFiles": true`
- `"chat.useAgentsMdFile": true`
- `"chat.includeApplyingInstructions": true`
- `"chat.includeReferencedInstructions": true`

## 5) Source-of-truth model (multi-agent)

Canonical role-based instruction sources live in:

- `10-templates/agent-instructions/base.md`
- `10-templates/agent-instructions/roles/implementation-specialist.md`
- `10-templates/agent-instructions/roles/compliance-officer.md`
- `10-templates/compliance-officer-pr-review-brief.md` (required protocol include for Compliance Officer)

These files are tool-agnostic and should be reused by non-Codex runtimes (for example, Copilot or Ollama adapters) rather than duplicating role logic in vendor-specific locations.

Published GHCR role packages are role-repo driven:

- Build pipeline fetches each role repo and uses role-repo `AGENTS.md` as runtime instruction source for that role image.
- If role-repo source is unavailable in build context, image build falls back to repository-governed instruction sources in `Context-Engineering`.
- Governance remains authoritative in `Context-Engineering`; role repos are generated/synced distribution artifacts.

To update the default Codex settings for this workstation config:

1. Edit `.devcontainer-workstation/codex/config.toml` (base defaults) and/or `.devcontainer-workstation/codex/role-profiles/*.env` (role overlay values)
2. Rebuild/restart:

```bash
$COMPOSE_CMD up -d --build implementation-workstation
```
