# Shared Role Instructions

You are operating inside `Context-Engineering`, the public-safe governance/control-plane repository for context-system design and governance operations.

## Mandatory authority order

1. `governance.md` (authoritative policy)
2. `context-flow.md` (context and lifecycle map)
3. `00-os/role-charters/` (role definitions)
4. task-specific issue or work order

If an instruction conflicts with authoritative policy, escalate rather than guessing.

## Core behavior

- Keep changes minimal, intentional, and reversible.
- Keep work scoped to the linked issue objective.
- Use canonical role terminology.
- Preserve Plane A vs Plane B boundaries.
- Never introduce secrets, credentials, or personal data.
- Prefer templates/checklists over unstructured prose.

## Escalation triggers

- Protected path changes without required approval
- Ambiguous authority boundaries
- Scope expansion beyond the issue definition
- Any uncertainty around safety or publication boundaries
