# Role Creation Work Order (Template)

Use this template in the **body of a GitHub Issue** when the Issue is intended to execute a full, governed role rollout from definition through role-repo and container validation.

**Rule:** Section headings in this template are **normative**. Do not rename them.

---

## Implementation Specialist Work Order (Authoritative)

## Objective
Describe the single role-creation outcome (1-3 sentences). Keep it measurable.

## Scope (Allowed Changes)
List the **only** files/folders the Implementation Specialist may modify for this role rollout.

- The Implementation Specialist may ONLY modify:
  - `00-os/role-charters/<role-slug>.md`
  - `10-templates/agent-instructions/roles/<role-slug>.md`
  - `10-templates/job-description-spec/roles/<role-slug>.json`
  - `.devcontainer-workstation/codex/role-profiles/<role-slug>.env`
  - `.devcontainer-workstation/docker-compose.yml`
  - `.devcontainer-workstation/docker-compose.ghcr.yml`
  - `.devcontainer-workstation/scripts/start-role-workstation.sh`
  - `.devcontainer-workstation/README.md`
  - `.github/workflows/sync-role-repos.yml`
  - `.github/workflows/publish-role-workstation-images.yml`
  - `10-templates/repo-starters/role-repo-template/**` (only if template source changes are explicitly required)
  - Any additional files explicitly listed below for this role

State whether new files may be created (default: **Yes**, only those implied by the listed paths and role slug).

The Implementation Specialist must not infer additional scope beyond what is explicitly listed here.

## Out of Scope
List explicit exclusions so scope does not expand.

- Any file not listed in Scope
- Protected artifacts unless explicitly included:
  - `governance.md`
  - `context-flow.md`
  - `00-os/**` files other than the role charter in Scope
- Unrelated refactors or formatting-only edits
- Runtime behavior changes unrelated to adding the new role
- Merging PRs

The Implementation Specialist must not modify any file/path not explicitly listed in Scope.

## Required Inputs
Fill in all placeholders before execution.

- Role title: `<Role Title>`
- Role slug (kebab-case): `<role-slug>`
- Role repo owner: `<github-owner>`
- Role repo name (default): `context-engineering-role-<role-slug>`
- Role workstation service name: `<role-slug>-workstation`
- Role profile env file: `.devcontainer-workstation/codex/role-profiles/<role-slug>.env`

## Implementation Requirements
Provide deterministic edits and execution steps.

### 1) Create role charter (governed role definition)
- File: `00-os/role-charters/<role-slug>.md`
- Source scaffold: `10-templates/role-charters/_template-role-charter.md`
- Ensure the charter explicitly defines:
  - Role purpose
  - Core responsibilities
  - Explicit non-responsibilities
  - Decision rights
  - Escalation triggers
  - Required inputs/references
  - Success measures

### 2) Create role instruction source
- File: `10-templates/agent-instructions/roles/<role-slug>.md`
- Align with `10-templates/agent-instructions/base.md`
- Include role-specific operating boundaries and escalation rules derived from charter/governance.

### 3) Create role job-description spec
- File: `10-templates/job-description-spec/roles/<role-slug>.json`
- Must satisfy required schema/sections used by:
  - `10-templates/repo-starters/role-repo-template/scripts/build-agent-job-description.py`
- Ensure generated `AGENTS.md` can be assembled without manual edits.

### 4) Wire workstation runtime for role
- Add role profile env:
  - `.devcontainer-workstation/codex/role-profiles/<role-slug>.env`
- Add role service/profile entries in:
  - `.devcontainer-workstation/docker-compose.yml`
  - `.devcontainer-workstation/docker-compose.ghcr.yml`

### 5) Update workstation launcher touchpoints
- Update role selection/mapping in `.devcontainer-workstation/scripts/start-role-workstation.sh`.
- Update launcher guidance in `.devcontainer-workstation/README.md` if role-specific examples or role lists are included.

### 6) Add role to sync/publish workflow matrices
- Update role matrix entries in:
  - `.github/workflows/sync-role-repos.yml`
  - `.github/workflows/publish-role-workstation-images.yml`
- Ensure role repo naming is consistent (`context-engineering-role-<role-slug>`).

### 7) Run role onboarding preflight validator
Run:
```bash
10-templates/repo-starters/role-repo-template/scripts/validate-role-onboarding.sh \
  --role-slug <role-slug>
```
Address any missing touchpoints before continuing.

### 8) Create public role repo and initial scaffold
Run:
```bash
10-templates/repo-starters/role-repo-template/scripts/create-public-role-repo.sh \
  --role-slug <role-slug> \
  --owner <github-owner>
```

### 9) Verify sync automation and role-repo PR
Run sync workflow (manual or push-triggered) and verify:
- Role sync job succeeds
- Sync PR exists in role repo from `sync/role-repo/<role-slug>` to `main`
- Managed artifacts updated:
  - `AGENTS.md`
  - `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
  - `.vscode/settings.json`
  - `README.md`

### 10) Verify image publish and container usability
Run publish workflow and verify role job succeeds.
Validate published image pull/run for the new role profile and confirm instruction files resolve in runtime.

### 11) Capture evidence in PR
Include run URLs and verification notes for:
- Role repo creation
- Sync workflow
- Publish workflow
- Container smoke check

## Acceptance Criteria
Use checkboxes. Keep these binary.

- [ ] Role charter exists at `00-os/role-charters/<role-slug>.md`
- [ ] Role instruction source exists at `10-templates/agent-instructions/roles/<role-slug>.md`
- [ ] Role job spec exists at `10-templates/job-description-spec/roles/<role-slug>.json`
- [ ] Role profile env exists at `.devcontainer-workstation/codex/role-profiles/<role-slug>.env`
- [ ] Role is wired in both compose files
- [ ] Launcher touchpoints updated in `.devcontainer-workstation/scripts/start-role-workstation.sh` and `.devcontainer-workstation/README.md`
- [ ] Role is wired in sync and publish workflow matrices
- [ ] Public role repo exists at `<github-owner>/context-engineering-role-<role-slug>`
- [ ] Sync workflow role job succeeded and produced/updated role-repo PR
- [ ] Publish workflow role job succeeded for the new role
- [ ] Only files listed in Scope were modified
- [ ] No secrets, tokens, internal hostnames, IPs, or personal data introduced

## PR Instructions
- Open a PR titled: `Implementation Specialist: Add <role-slug> role end-to-end`
- Include a summary mapped to Acceptance Criteria
- Include machine-readable metadata:
  - `Primary-Role: Implementation Specialist`
  - `Reviewed-By-Role: Compliance Officer`
  - `Executive-Sponsor-Approval: Required` if protected artifacts are touched, otherwise `Not-Required`
- Link and close the Issue in the PR description (example: `Closes #<ISSUE_NUMBER>`)
- Apply labels:
  - `role:implementation-specialist`
  - exactly one `status:*` label
- Do not merge the PR

### Branching (Required)
Create a fresh branch for the Issue using GitHub CLI default naming.
Manual `git checkout -b` is not allowed for Issue-driven work.

Required commands (example):
```bash
gh issue develop <ISSUE_NUMBER> --checkout
git branch --show-current
```

Stop Condition:
- If not on a fresh Issue branch, stop and request human input.

## Stop Conditions
Stop execution immediately and request human input if:
- The role slug/title conflicts with existing role artifacts
- Required scope expansion is needed beyond this Issue
- Workflow permissions/secrets prevent deterministic validation
- Any instruction is ambiguous
